# Podbean Uploader

Podbean Uploader is written using React and Electron to simplify the process of uploading a podcast to Podbean.

Some of the issues it tries to solve:

- Has a template for renaming the podcast (Title - Speaker - Day/Time - Date)
- Renames the file to the name used in the template.
- Initiate rename/publish before upload is complete and do rename/publish once upload finishes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
